Q: Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
A: The client for this project was DriverPass, a company that helps train new drivers to pass their liscence test. They wanted an online system that would allow customers to take online classes, schedule driving practice with the drivers the company has on staff, and to make payments.
Q: What did you do particularly well?
A: For this project I went deep into understanding the functional and non-functional requirments of such a system which I think I hit all the important needs as wells as evaluated what would make the most sense to get the system to operate efficiently.
Q: If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
A: I would have gone through more iterations of the use case diagram. I started off with a decent base but between some peer input and seeing other examples I now know I could have covered more cases, combined a couple, and made the whole diagram more readable.
Q: How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
A: I read and re-read the transcript from the customer interview, looked into similar systems, and looked at what other customers had wanted in those systems. A system that works but that doesn't actually meet the customers needs is the same as a system that doesn't work. A user's needs dictate what the system needs to be able to do as it is being created to meet an unmet need.
Q: How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
A: I used to approach designing software from a place of jumping right into the programming but I have come to learn, through several classes, that this is wastful of both time and resources. You need to plan things out and have a back and forth with your peers and the customer to create the best framework before a single line of code has been written.
